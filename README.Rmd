These datasets support the implementation in R of
the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment),
which is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial
assets and climate scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
allocation impacts the climate. Because both financial institutions
and market data providers keep their data private, this package
provides fake, public data to enable the development and use of
'PACTA' in R.

## Installation

Install the released version of r2dii.data from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("r2dii.data")
```

Or install the development version of r2dii.data with something like this:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.data")
```
