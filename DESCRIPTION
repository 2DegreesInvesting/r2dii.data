Description: These datasets support the implementation in R of
    the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment).
    'PACTA' is free software tool that calculates the alignment between
    climate scenarios and financial assets
    (<https://www.transitionmonitor.com/>). Banks, for example, use it to
    test if their corporate-lending portfolios align with a benchmark of
    two degrees celsius, and thus understand how the money they lend may
    impact the climate. Because financial institutions keep their data
    private, this package provides public datasets to enable the
    development of 'PACTA' in R.
