These datasets support the implementation in R of the software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment). 'PACTA' is a free tool that calculates the alignment between financial assets and climate scenarios (<https://www.transitionmonitor.com/>). Banks, for example, use it to test if their corporate lending portfolios align with a benchmark of two degrees Celsius, and thus to understand how the money they lend may impact the climate. Because financial institutions keep their data private, this package provides public datasets to help build and train users of 'PACTA' in R.

## Installation
